# Backend

This is the backend part of the application, which uses [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org), with [Express](https://expressjs.com) as a server. For more information on the technologies used, head to [About the technology](<##About\ the\ technology>).

The initial project was created following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8).

## Getting Started

This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to handle packages and dependencies, so upon cloning the project, you'll need to run `yarn install` to fetch all of the dependencies we need.

After having installed all the dependencies, you can run `yarn watch` to start watching for changes in files. This will compile typescript files to javascript files in the `dist` folder.

In another terminal, run `yarn dev` to start `nodemon`, which will watch for changes in the javascript files generated by `yarn watch` and actually start the server.

You can also just run `yarn start` to start the server without watching for changes (**NOTE**: this runs javascript files in the `dist` folder, so you need to compile the project first).

## About the technology

### Typescript

Typescript is a superset of javascript, which adds types to it. It is becoming the standard in the industry, because it provides the ease of development of javascript, with the safety of static types.

### Express

Express is a web framework that makes developing servers in `node` really easy. It uses a middleware architecture (in this project, there's the `cors` and the `json` middlewares) to make development easier. Compared to other web frameworks, such as Elixir's Phoenix or F#'s Giraffe, Express makes it much easier to make simple, compact applications, because it doesn't require an entire file structure, or specific architecture.
